Chromium extension to download Episodes from Dropout

V1.0.0 Released!
I currently don't plan to relase this to the chrome web-store. 


Steps to Manually Install a .crx Chrome Extension


### - Download the .crx File:
    Obtain the .crx file for the extension from the relases page (https://github.com/ThaBlazee/dropout-downloader/releases).

### - Open Your Chromium-based Browser:

    Open Chrome, Edge, Brave, or another Chromium-based browser.

### - Navigate to the Extensions Page:

    In Chrome, you can enter chrome://extensions/ in the address bar.  
    In Edge, enter edge://extensions/.  
    In Brave, enter brave://extensions/.  

### - Enable Developer Mode:

    On the Extensions page, find the "Developer mode" toggle (usually at the top right) and enable it.

### - Install the Extension:

    Drag and drop the downloaded .crx file onto the Extensions page. Alternatively, you can use the "Load unpacked" option and select the extracted folder of the extension if you have it.
    
    You should see a prompt asking you to confirm the installation of the extension. Review the permissions and click "Add extension" or a similar option to confirm.

### - Check the Extension:

    Once installed, the extension should appear in your list of extensions. You might need to pin it to your browser's toolbar for easy access.
